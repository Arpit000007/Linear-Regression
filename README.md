**Linear Regression**

This assignment involves experimenting with linear regression using synthetic and real-world datasets. The goal is to understand how linear regression performs under different scenarios, fit models to various datasets, and evaluate performance using different error metrics. The tasks include simple and polynomial regression, regularization techniques, multiple linear regression, and interaction effects.

The assignment is divided into three main parts:

1) Simple and Polynomial Regression on synthetic data
2) Multiple Linear Regression on a credit dataset
3) Analyzing correlation and prediction in a shark attacks dataset
